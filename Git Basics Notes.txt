What is GIT 
=========
# Free and open source distributed Version Control System (VCS)
	=> Free - anyone can download, use, modify, and distribute Git without having to pay any fees
	=> Open Source - source code is freely available for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute
	=> Distributed VCS - 
		> allows multiple users to work on the same codebase simultaneously and independently.
		> every developer has a complete copy of the codebase and its history on their local machine.

# Developed by - Linus Torvalds (creator of linux OS)
# One of the biggest advantages - its branching capabilities
# Git help you to do the version control by its own but we need to mention what we are doing by commands. 
# Trunk Based Development - A term used in development 
# we can revert back to previous version. 

Why Git  : 
	=> Free => Open Source => Super Fast => Scalable	=> Branching and merging.

Centralized | Decentralized  | Distributed (Systems)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Centralized - All resources and data are managed and controlled by a central authority, typically a server or mainframe. 
							Eg : Online social applications like FB, Twitter, Quora
	2. Decentralized - Resources and data are distributed across multiple nodes or servers, and there is no central authority or server controlling everything	(P2P  - Peer to Peer)
								Eg: A hotel decide to open in new state : new location freedom to operate independently
	3. Distributed - Similar to a decentralized system
						 - Resources and data are distributed across multiple nodes or servers but here node or server are not working together rather wrking individually
							Eg: Telephone , Internet, Git
	# Early we are using Centralized VCS and now we are usinf Distributed VCS. 


Git branching and Merging
---------------------------------
It allow you to create separate lines of development within a single repository, and then merge those lines of development back together. 
	# Create a new branch - `git branch <branch-name>`
	# Switch to a different branch - `git checkout <branch-name>`
	# Make changes and commit - `git commit`
	# Merge branches - `git merge <branch-name>`
	# Delete a branch - `git branch -d <branch-name>`

Git Workflows
---------------------
	# Gitflow workflow - Its a branching model [here we have a development branch, a release branch, and a master branch]
									> Developers work on feature branches that are merged into the development branch
									>  Then merged into the release branch for testing and bug fixes
									> Once the release branch is stable, it is merged into the master branch for deployment
									
	# GitHub flow - Its is a lightweight workflow [here we have a Single/Master branch - after the devs create featur branch and merge it when they finish]
	# GitLab flow - similar to the GitHub flow, Here After the development they test and review the code then only it Merge to the Master Branch for Deployment. 

Git hosting platforms :
	1. GitHub - Build for Developers. 
	2. GitLab - Maily for Modern Developers. 
	3. Bitbucket - Built for Professional Teams

Where all we can use : 
	1. CMD (command line)
	2. code editors & IDEs (vs code)
	3. GUI (Linux, windows, MAC ..etc)
	
Note : Everyone usind command line bcz GUI tool have limitation, not always available but we can use. 
		=> Always use right tool for your work/ job.

==========================================================================

Getting Started : 
	1. Install Git in your machine
	2. We can work with GitHub | GitLab 
	=> GitHub 
		1. SignIn or SignUp
		2. Create a Repository(a place wher u can put ur prjt)
			=> Give a name for repository
			=> make public or private with a README file. 
			=> Create Repo.
		3. After created Repo, we can create a new file and commit it to the Repo. 
			=> Everytime we create a new file or adding new changes give a good messge 
		
	=> Using GIT BASH Terminal : (Commands and Working)
		 ===================
		# We can use any terminal like CMD, Powershell ...etc
		# First we need to configure few things - username, email and password. 
		
				=> `git config --global user.name "Shinto Chandy"`			// uname
				=> `git config --global user.email shintochandy642@gmail.com`		// email
				=> `git config --global init.defaultBranch main`			// setting default branch
				=> `git config --list`			// list all the configured details.

		# if U want to know more about "git config" use 
				
				=> `git <command> -h` 	// will list the ways we can configure things
				=> `git help <command>`	// git help config - will open more details in browser. 
				
		# To clear the terminal - need a fresh look
		
				=> clear 	// use this command.
				
		# Create Initial Repository : 
				=> First go to the current directory where ur files are by :
				
					- `cd D:\Backup_Schandy\MyNotes\Git\<files>` 		// upto that folder where ur files available. 
					
				=> `git init` 	// initialize that folder and files to git repository and now we are in (main) branch. 
						Explantion - 1st step in setting up a new Git repository on your local machine. 
										- Git creates a new .git directory in the root of your project folder. This directory contains all the necessary Git metadata and configuration files that Git uses to track changes to your project files and manage version control. Actually this .get folder is hidden in your explorer.
										
		# Know the current STATUS of that folder :
				=> `git status` 		// will get the status of our repository - will show the added and non-added files to the repository by green and red color.	(Red - Git can't track the changes | Green - Can Track all the changes that we made)
		
		# We can ADD file to the repository :
				=> `git add <filename>`		//  this will add file which can track by git. (show in Green color.)
				=> `git status` // will give you the current status of that file
				=> `git rm --cached <file>` 	// this cmd will help to untrack or remove that file form git.
		
		# How to Completely IGNORE a file from Tracking :
				=> create a .gitignore in your repository in local.
				=> Inside this file we can define what all files that we need to ignore with the help of .extenction //reffer the file created in local machine. (if you want to ignore all .txt file use a * symboll infront of extenction)
				=> `git status` //now git will ingnore and will not show that file.
	
		# ADD entire files or folder trackable / add to staging environment : (Staging - holding place before commiting)
				=> `git add --all` | `git add -A` | `git add .`	// . for entire directory
				=> `git status` 		// will show all files that git can track in green clr.
		
		NOTE : we have 3 stages - (1). Working Files in Local  (2). Stagging	(3). Committing
		
		# COMMITTING Files : 
				=> Means writting an entry into the history book, likwise we can track all the changes. 
				=> `git commit -m "first commit - comitting all file to repository"`		// commiting all file (-m specify the commit msg)
				=> `git commit <filename> -m "first commit - comitting all file to repository"	 // to commit specifc file
				=> `git status`
				
		# Make CHANGES in file and Viewing DIFFERENCE'S :
				=> `git staus` 	// will show we modifued the file in red color
				=> `git diff`		// will show what changes you made in that file ( will display old one in red and new in green clr)
				=> `git add <filename>` 	// added this changed file to staging and after that we will commit the file.
				=> `git restore --staged <filename>`	// RESTORE the already staged file back to local bcz we are currently working on it. (Error showing use : `git init`)
				=> `git commit -a -m "Updated Text in the file"`		// will DIRECTLY PASS through Staging and Commit the File. 
		
		# DELETING/ removing Files | RESTORING it back :
				=> `git rm "<filename>"` 						// remove the file from dir
				=> `git status`										// will show that we deleted one file int it 
				=> `git restore --staged "<filename>"`	// will restore the deleted file from stagging envo
				=> `git restore <filename>`					// restoring back to repo
				
		# RENAMING Files : 
				=> `git mv "<oldfilename>" "<newFileName>"` 			// rename the old name to new name.
				=> `git status`		// will show the renamed file in staged envo, so commit it back
				=> `git commit -m "Image name remaned"`
		
		# Viewing Commit HISTORY with git LOG :
				=> `git log`		// view the commited log history. 
				=> `git log --oneline`		// show the commits in one line.
				=> `git log -p` 				// for viweing the commits by pressing the down arrow - Press 'Q' exit/Quit from that view. 
		
		# AMEND the Commited Text : 
				=> git commit -m "The Image name renamed to new Name" --amend		// will change the alredy commited wrng txt to new one. 
				=> `git log -p`	// view the commited changes. 
		
		# RESET to Previous commit : 
				=> `git reset <commit Value>`				// jumb back to previous commit .
				=> `git restore <file>` 							// discard changes in current wrking directory
		
		# REBASE the git Repo :
				=> `git rebase -i  --root` 			// will open an editor where we can edit the view commits, order, merge the commits ...etc.
				
		# BRANCHING : 
				=> `git branch <BranchName>`		// for creating new branch for making any changes or fixing bugs.
				=> `git branch`									// to view all branches. (also we can view the active current branch in green clr with * symbol )
				=> `git switch <BranchName>`			// will swith you to another branch from current branch. Check which brand is active.
				=> Make the necessary changes in any of the file and COMMIT it to the New Branch. (Note : If you make changes in 1 branch then it only reflect in that branch only untill to merge it to main branch.)
			
		# MERGE Branches :
				=> git merge -m "<Any Contents that you want to give.>" <MergingBranchName>			// Merge the changes in the created branch with Main branch 
				=>  `git branch <BranchName>`		// for creating new branch for making any changes or fixing bugs.
				=> `git branch`									// to view all branches. (also we can view the active current branch in green clr with * symbol )
				=> git switch <BranchName>			// will swith you to another branch from current branch. Check which brand is active.
				=> Now we can see the file which edited in older branch merged with main branch.
		
		# DELETE Branches :
				=> `git branch -d <BranchName>`		// will delete the selected branch. 
				=> `git branch`									// view branches
		
		# MERGE CONFLITS :
				=> `git switch -c <BranchName>`		// will create(-c) a new branch and switch to the created branch.
				=> `git branch`	
				=> `git commit -a -m "Message"`		// First edit a file and then commit again those to the new branch after that only we Merge it to "main branch"
				=> The Merge conflict will look like :
						<<<<<<<< Head		- Represent the Main branch with ====== arrow
						>>>>>>>> BranchName - Represent the data from New Branch  			// this issue happen when u try to update the file from both branches and trying to merge.
				=> So in this case, remove the Text that you don't want and keep the text that u need to merge from the .txt file.
			
		Note : This all was the fundementals of wrking with Git - Basically the GIT FLOW.
				 : Still this much we worked on the Git repository which is hosted on your LOCAL Computer,
				 : Next we are going to host the repository in ClOUD. Popular Cloud repo is GITHUB.
		
	=> GITHUB - Getting Started
		========
		# Create an account and signin
		# Create a new Repository.
				* Give a repo name - Public/Private - README file - gitgnore and Licence File
				* Here we have : 
					1. create a new repository on the command line
					2. push an existing repository from the command line
					3. import code from another repository
				* we are going with 2nd coz we already have one. So copyt the URL and run it in GIT BASH.		// will establish a remote connection with GitHub. (`git remote add origin https://github.com/Shinto-chandy/PracticingGit.git`)
				* run the 2nd cmd - (`git branch -M main`) 		// make the target branch as main
				* Push the entire local repo code to github (`git push -u origin main`)			// push local repo to cloud.
				* since we have synced everything with GitHub.			// go to github and see those file with only 1 branch `main`
				* `git push --all`					// PUSH all your branches to GitHub - now we  got all out branched in github
		
		# Working with FILES : 
				=> Here we can view, edit and do all the changes that we done in Local.
				=> Add new files / edit / add new commits direclty from their / edit projt details ...etc 
				
		
		# ISSUES :
				=> On Github repo next to  <> code ISSUE option was their - her we can Raise an issue By Clicking "NEW ISSUE"
				=> Give a Title, descriptions, ASSIGN that issue to someone in ur team or to yourself , give a LABEL , 
				=> Submit new issue 				// Github is a publc platform where others  can discuss and comment on your raised ISSUE. 
			
		# PULL Request :
				=> After that u can go to ur file and click edit icon and make necessary changes to File. 
				=> Give necessary commit message and you can do 2 things
						1. Direcly COMMIT to main branch
						2. Create a new Branch for this Commit msg and Start a PULL Request. 			// PULL REQUEST - Means that our changes has to been approved or reviewd by someone before u PUSH it to MAIN Branch. 
							* After entering the above details do - PROPOSE CHANGES. 					// will create a new branch for this PULL request. 
							* Create a PULL Request. (Give a Msg and description) 
							* After successfull completion of PULL Request , if everything looks good then we can "MERGE PULL REQUEST"		// NB : 
								NOTE : If u want to resolve an ISSUE with this PULL and MERGE request > Right side/ Development/ Her U can choose the ISSUE and resolve it (Basically tie back to this issue on this PULL & MERGE request)
							* Merge and Confirm the MSG. 					// check the ISSUE section the Issue will now RESOLVED. 
				=> Thats it
				
		# OTHER TABS : 
				=> Actions - we can run different TESTS, write prgms to manage repo
				=> Projects - Prjt mgmnt view, View all ISSUES, View all PULL requests, FILTER differnt Views
				=> Wiki - We can Document out Code here
				=> Security - manage all the policies,  
				=> Insights - Who all are contributing to Prjt ,Traffic in prjt, How many issues closed, how many commits, ..etc
				=> Settings - Settings related to ur prjt, Add additional people wrk with ur prjt, 
		
		# RELEASES :
				=> From main page we can create RELEASE version of our doc or prjt (right side - Releases.)
				=> Create a new Release 
				=> Create a tag called Release and create  a release title (V1.0.0)			// see the suggestions to create the releases..
				=> This will Generate 2 .zip files that anyone can come and download the prjt data on that release. 
				
		# FETCH & PULL : 
				=> Get the changes back to Local from the cloud.
				=> `git fetch`			// will download all the history from the remote tracking branches
				=> `git merge`			// will merge it with the files in Local Machine
				=> `git pull` 				// Combination of both FETCH and MERGE cmds. i.e it combines both their duties at a time. 
				Note : This will change all the things in Local that you made changes on CLoud. 
			
 HOORAY, ALL DONE !
